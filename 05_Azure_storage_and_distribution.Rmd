# Accessing the Azure Storage

## Fetching files from the cluster
Lets modify the closing prices example and write on disk results of each iteration
```{r eval = TRUE}
n <- 100000
iterations <- 10
closingPrices <- foreach(i = seq(iterations), .combine = "c") %dopar% {
    results <- replicate(n/iterations, getClosingPrice())
    results_file <- sprintf("results_iteration_%s.csv", i)
    write.csv(results, results_file, row.names = FALSE)
    return(results)
}
hist(closingPrices)
```


Now lets download the files generated.

```{r eval = FALSE}
getJobFile(jobId = "job20200916105340", taskId = 1, filePath = results_file, downloadPath = "results_file_iteration_1.csv")
```
